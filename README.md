## Overview

This project uses GitOps principles to streamline infrastructure and application deployment. It leverages Github Actions CI/CD with tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Docker, to ensure efficient and automated provisioning and monitoring.

## Objectives

- **Cloud cost optimization** with cost estimation tools like InfraCost.  
- **GitOps workflows** for seamless automation.  
- **Terraform + Ansible integration** for infrastructure management and monitoring stack setup.  
- **Git branching strategies** for streamlined CI/CD pipelines.  

## Technologies
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool to provision cloud resources.
- **Ansible**: Configuration management tool used for provisioning and configuring servers.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package the application and monitoring stacks.
- **Traefik**: Reverse proxy for routing traffic between containers.
- **Grafana**: Used to monitor and visualize container-level metrics and logs.  
- **Prometheus**: collection of metrics
- **cAdvisor**: exposes container-level metrics
- **Loki**: log aggregation
- **Promtail**: log collection

## Pipeline Configuration Files
The CI/CD pipelines are divided into modular `.yml`files for better organization and maintainability:

- Infrastructure Pipelines:
  - `terraform-validate.yml`: Validates Terraform configurations.
  - `terraform-plan.yml`: Runs terraform plan and includes cost estimation in PR comments.
  - `terraform-apply.yml`: Applies the Terraform configuration with auto-approval.
  - `ansible-monitoring.yml`: Deploys the monitoring stack using Ansible.
  
  These workflows are independently managed on the `infra_features` and `infra_main` branches.
- Application Pipelines:
  - `ci-frontend.yml`: Builds, test, packages and pushes the frontend Docker images, then updates compose.yml.
  - `cd-frontend.yml`: Deploys the frontend container in the cloud.
  - `ci-backend.yml`: Builds, test, packages and pushes the backend Docker images, then updates compose.yml.
  - `cd-backend.yml`: Deploys the backend, posgresql, and adminer containers in the cloud.

  These workflows are independently managed on the `integration` and `deployment` branches.


## Infrastructure Pipelines
These pipelines automates infrastructure provisioning and monitoring stack setup using Terraform and Ansible. Additionally, it utilizes an incredible tool such as InfraCost for cost breakdown, estimation and optimization.

### Branching Strategy
---
- `infra_features`: For writing and testing Terraform configurations.
- `infra_main`: The main branch for infrastructure management and provisioning.

### Pipeline Workflow
---
- Workflow Steps:
  - Push to `infra_features`: Triggers `terraform-validate.yml` to ensure configuration correctness.
  - Pull Request to `infra_main`: Triggers `terraform-plan.yml` which returns infrastructure plan and cost analysis as a PR comment.
  - Merge to `infra_main`: Triggers `terraform-apply.yml`terraform apply to provision infrastructure resources. `terraform-apply.yml` on successful completion, then trigger `ansible-monitoring.yml` to configure the server and deploy the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail & Cadvisor).
  
## Application Pipelines
The application pipeline build, test, packages and deploy the three-tier application stack.
### Branching Strategy
---
The two branches will start where continuous 
- `integration`: For managing the continuous integration of the applications
- `deployment`: For managing the continuous deployment of the containerized applications.

### Pipeline Workflow
---
- Workflow Steps:
  - Push to `integration`: Build Docker images for the application.
    - `ci-frontend.yml`: This pipeline is triggered when changes are made to the `frontend/` folder. Build, test and push the frontend image to dockerhub. Then it updates compose.yml with the recent frontend image tag.
    - `ci-backend.yml`: This pipeline is triggered when changes are made to the `backend/` folder. Build, test and push the backend image to dockerhub. Then it updates compose.yml with the recent backend image tag.

  - Merge from `integration` to `deployment`: Deploys the application stack to the provisioned cloud infrastructure.
    - `cd-frontend.yml`: This pipeline is triggered when changes are made to the `frontend/` folder. It pulls the updated docker image and deploys it.
    - `cd-backend.yml`: This pipeline is triggered when changes are made to the `backend/` folder. It pulls the updated docker image and deploys it.
